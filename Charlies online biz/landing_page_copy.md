## PROBLEM AGITATION

### Let's Be Real: Most "AI Business" Advice is Hot Garbage 🗑️

You've seen the tweets. 

*"Just use ChatGPT to print money!"*

*"AI passive income while you sleep!"*

*"Start an agency with $0!"*

**Cool. But where's the actual roadmap?**

Here's what nobody tells you:

- ❌ **The gurus** sell you $2,997 courses that regurgitate free YouTube content
- ❌ **The Twitter bros** flex revenue screenshots but won't show you the *process*
- ❌ **The "AI tools"** are expensive, complicated, and leave you more confused than when you started
- ❌ **The "communities"** are just Discord servers full of people as lost as you are

**So you end up:**
- Paralyzed by 47 different "business models"
- $500 deep in tools you don't know how to use
- Watching another "day in the life of a solopreneur" video at 2 AM
- Wondering if you're just... not cut out for this

**Spoiler: You are.** You just need the cheat codes nobody's sharing.

## SOLUTION PRESENTATION

### Enter: The $100 AI Business Blueprint

**This isn't theory. This is a step-by-step execution manual.**

We stripped away the fluff, the hype, and the $10K course price tags. What's left? A lean, mean, profit-generating machine you can build in a week—with tools you already know (or can learn in an afternoon).

**The premise is simple:**
1. Pick your play (from 5 proven models)
2. Build your stack (under $100, no exceptions)
3. Launch in 7 days (even if you have a day job)
4. Get your first paying customer (we'll show you exactly how)

**No venture capital. No co-founder drama. No 6-month "building in public" phase.**

Just you, $100, and a blueprint that actually works.

✅ You get first-mover advantage  
✅ You get direct access (we're still small enough to reply to every email)  
✅ You shape what comes next (early buyers get input on future updates)  
✅ You lock in the lowest price it'll ever be  

**The people buying this week?** They're the ones who'll be case studies in six months. 

**Will you be one of them?**

### Your AI Business Won't Build Itself

**You have three options:**

1. **Keep consuming.** Watch more videos. Read more threads. Stay exactly where you are.
2. **Go it alone.** Spend 6 months figuring out what we distilled into 7 days.
3. **Grab the Blueprint.** Start building this weekend. Have something to show for it by Monday.

**The choice is yours. But the price? That changes soon.**
